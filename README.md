## Getting Started

First of all, open Command Line in \Assembler folder and then type:

*WITHOUT QUOTES*

```
.\Assembler "INPUT_FILE_NAME.asm" "OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.mif"
```

Typing without output file name also works:

```
.\Assembler "INPUT_FILE_NAME.asm"
```
In this case, a file named "Memoria.mif" will be created
